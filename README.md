This is a fun little pet project that can ingest [ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADS-B) messages sent from nearby planes and analyze them.

I started working on it after I left my position at OverDrive, and I decided to implement it in the most ostentatious, micro-service-y way I could. Essentially, the approach I would have shot down in my professional life!
Call it a palate cleanser.
